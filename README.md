SAUMA
=====

This is the frontend part of Sauma, a miniature project management app tailored
for one Finnish medium-size company in construction sector. More details in the
["main" repository](https://github.com/jrnn/sauma).

The frontend is implemented in React-Redux. The current web-based version is
intended only as a temporary prototype — and, personally, a learning experience
— in expectation of porting to mobile with React Native. (Given this excuse,
there is not a single test to be found anywhere **gasp**.)

A fair share of hours has been burnt on experimenting with structure, hierarchy
and division of responsibility between components, as well as Redux patterns. As
a result, directory structure is fragmented and somewhat messy, and a more
seasoned hand probably could spot all kinds of dodgy crap littered throughout.
